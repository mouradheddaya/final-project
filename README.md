** Widgets **
- dropdown of states
- radio buttons for the median price chart: All, top, bottom

1. Start with a base line: How well does Zillow buyer/seller index explain 6 month changes in median home value? How about 1 year?
a. Plot data points with a six month offset between the zillow buyer/seller index & the median home value.

--> add a line of best First

2. plot median house value on the map
  --> figure out how you want the user to narrow the area i.e. neighborhood, city, etc.

3. display map with average listing days in each area

3.	You should be able to have the highest success in areas with high foreclosure rates and  rapidly increasing home values
- based on the user input figure out best area to buy a home (highest Year over Year change in foreclosures/Year over Year growth in median home values)
-->	Table with top five results

Data used
1)	Seller/buyer index (City)
2)	City_zhvi (bottom tier, by city)
