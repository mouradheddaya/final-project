First look @ Zillow data
1.	How well does Zillow buyer/seller index explain 6-month changes in median home value? How about 1 year?

2.	You should be able to have the highest success in areas with high foreclosure rates and  rapidly increasing home values
o	Calculate the best neighborhood in Washington to buy a home (highest foreclosure rate & increasing home values)
o	Display map with median home prices
o	Display map with listing days
â€¢	Table with top five results
